    <h2> OKC Thunder Team History</h2>
    <p>The Oklahoma City Thunder began as the Seattle SuperSonics in 1967, winning their only NBA championship in 1979 before relocating to Oklahoma City in 2008 after a failed arena deal in Seattle. Renamed the Thunder, the team quickly rose to prominence with young stars Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Serge Ibaka, reaching the NBA Finals in 2012 but losing to the Miami Heat. Following Durant’s departure to the Warriors in 2016, Westbrook led the team and won MVP in 2017 while averaging a triple-double. A major rebuild began in 2019 with trades of Westbrook and Paul George, bringing in a trove of draft picks and rising talent like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Under SGA’s leadership and a new core including Josh Giddey, Jalen Williams, and Chet Holmgren, the Thunder completed their resurgence by winning the 2025 NBA Finals, marking a triumphant new chapter in franchise history.</p>
